## CG Docs Assignment: 
The idea is to create an in-house solution for managing files that helps in collaboration and easy file access from anywhere.

Please use the following libraries and versions:
   - ASP.NET Core 5.0+
   - HTML5
   - CSS3
   - Javascript

## The APIs: 
We want to create RESTful APIs for creating users and uploading files for different users. The APIs will perform CRUD operation for Users and Files.

Via a REST API it must be possible to:
- Create new user
- Authenticate a user 
- Upload a file 
- Create a folder
- Add file to a folder
- List all files for a user 
- List all files in a folder
- Search for files
- Delete a file
- Delete a folder
- View details of file
- View details of folder
- List recent files

A POSTman collection for the above APIs should be a part of the solution.
User management and authentication is a plus. The data have to be persisted in SQL Server using EF Core.

## The Frontend:
For the frontend, refer to *cg-docs-ui.pdf* in root directory.
